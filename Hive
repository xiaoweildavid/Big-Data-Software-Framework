# Create new tables in Hive, here is an example.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Table1 (
ID INT,
Department STRING,
Name STRING,
Date TIMESTAMP)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

# Here is a link about the comparison of different data file formats. 
# https://acadgild.com/blog/apache-hive-file-formats/
# By default, if we use TEXTFILE format then each line is considered as a record.

# Add values into the table.
INSERT INTO Table1 VALUES (1,'Sales', 'Peter', '2012-01-01');
